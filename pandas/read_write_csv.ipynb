    "What's a CSV file?\n",
    "CSV, or comma-separated values, is a common data storage file type. It's designed to store tabular data, just like a pandas DataFrame. It's a text file, where each row of data has its own line, and each value is separated by a comma. Almost every database, programming language, and piece of data analysis software can read and write CSV files. That makes it a good storage format if you need to share your data with other people who may be using different tools than you."
